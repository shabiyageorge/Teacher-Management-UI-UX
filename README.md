# ðŸŽ“ Teacher Management Interface

A **responsive**, **modern**, and **intuitive** teacher management interface created using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and designed for integration with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. This interface can be used to manage teacher details, qualifications, schedules, and availability in a clean and user-friendly layout.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project is a UI mockup of a Teacher Management Dashboard that displays:

- Teacher personal information (name, contact, email, etc.)
- Private and group qualifications with hourly rates
- A weekly availability schedule (Monday to Sunday)
- A sidebar navigation layout and tab system for sub-sections
- Responsive layout for modern browsers

Although the current version is static (HTML + TailwindCSS), it is structured to be easily converted into a full-featured web app using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**.
